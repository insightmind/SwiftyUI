## Example

The example application is the best way to see `SwiftyUI` in action. Simply open the `SwiftyUI.xcodeproj` and run the `Example` scheme.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

SwiftyUI is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```bash
pod 'SwiftyUI'
```

### Carthage

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

To integrate SwiftyUI into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
github "Niklas BuÃàlow/SwiftyUI"
```

Run `carthage update` to build the framework and drag the built `SwiftyUI.framework` into your Xcode project. 

On your application targets‚Äô ‚ÄúBuild Phases‚Äù settings tab, click the ‚Äú+‚Äù icon and choose ‚ÄúNew Run Script Phase‚Äù and add the Framework path as mentioned in [Carthage Getting started Step 4, 5 and 6](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/README.md#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos)

### Swift Package Manager

To integrate using Apple's [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/), add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://insightmind@github.com/insightmind/SwiftyUI.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

### Manually

If you prefer not to use any of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate SwiftyUI into your project manually. Simply drag the `Sources` Folder into your Xcode project.
